/*
    Errors

    A) Compile Errors: detected by the compiler
        A1) Syntax errors: the code violates the C++ synxtax rules
            - Missing semicolon
            - Unmatched parenthesis 
        A2) Type errors: 
            - Forget variable declaration
            - Store value of a wrong type

    B) Link-time errors: detected by the linker. Examples:
        - Missing library files
        - Missing functions

    C) Run-time errors: occur during program execution (no compile errors, no link-time errors)

    D) Logical errors: flawed logic by programmer/s
