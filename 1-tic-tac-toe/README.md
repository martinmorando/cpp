Very basic C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe while learning the language. This code will be updated as I continue learning more about the syntax.

Ideas to implement:
- [x] Accept multiple formats as input (1A, 1a, a1, A1)
- [x] Check for winner after player1 moves
- [ ] Play n rounds, count points and determine winner
- [ ] Polish UI (for example, bigger game board and/or ASCII art)
	- [x] Neater game board 
	- [x] Use of pauses	
	- [x] Clear console
	- [ ] Clear console [do again without system()](../lib-ncurses/README.md)
	- [ ] ASCII art
	- [ ] Change colors?
	- [ ] Sounds and/or music?
- [ ] Rewrite getWinnerLetter() in a more concise way
- [ ] Determine randomly which player goes first (if users want)
- [ ] Single-player mode (randomized)
- [ ] Comment more
- [ ] Refactor (too much repetitive code) (partially done)
- [ ] Test thoroughly
