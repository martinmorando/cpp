# C++

My notes on C++ and various programs I write while learning the syntax. I aim for a deeper understanding of the language over the long term.


## Quick Overview
- Created in 1979 by Bell Laboratories
- General-purpose coding language, derived from C language


## Motivations to learn C++
- I want to gain a better understanding of memory manipulation
- Bitcoin Core is written in C++ and I want to explore its source code directly to understand its workings without intermediaries, the intact truth
- Its a must in order to join the league of shadowy super coders, of course


## Programs
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: simple console-based game for 2 players


## Compiling & Running C++ Programs
### Alternative A: fast
1. Compile the source code to generate the executable (AKA machine code or object code), using command: `g++ name.cpp`. 
2. Run the executable file, using command: `./name.out`

### Alternative B: custom name
1. Compile: `g++ file.cpp -o customname`
2. Run: `./customname`
