# C++

My notes on C++ and various programs I write while learning the syntax. I aim for a deeper understanding of the language over the long term.

# Motivations to learn C++
- I want to gain a better understanding of memory manipulation
- Bitcoin Core is written in C++ and I want to explore its source code directly to understand its workings without intermediaries, the intact truth
- Its a must in order to enter the league of shadowy super coders, of course

# Programs
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: simple console-based game for 2 players
